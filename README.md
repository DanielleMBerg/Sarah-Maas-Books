# Sarah-Maas-Books
Shows a list of books by Sarah Maas. Information is fetched from the Open Library API.

The basics of the code was provided to me by my MIT course. I refactored the code to create a seperate CSS file, and to link to a new API. Linking to the new API required me to update the code with the new data and array key/value pairs. I also added style to the webpage (color, text, border). I also changed the type of bootstrap component that was used.

# How to Run
To run on your own device, download all the files (except for the LICENSE file and the README file) and save them in one folder. Open your terminal, navigate to the folder, run http-server.

# Future Improvements
A few improvments that may be helpful would be: adding a search option so that not just Sarah Maas books can be shown.

# License
See the attached LICENSE file.
